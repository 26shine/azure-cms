# Analysis and Justification for Deploying the CMS App

## Analyzing VM and App Service Options

### Costs
- **VM (Virtual Machine):** 
  - Costs include compute resources, storage, and network bandwidth.
  - Higher operational costs due to manual management and maintenance.
- **App Service:** 
  - Costs include compute resources, storage, and bandwidth.
  - Generally more cost-effective due to managed nature.

### Scalability
- **VM:**
  - Manual scaling or use of autoscaling solutions.
  - Scaling may lead to downtime.
- **App Service:**
  - Built-in auto-scaling features.
  - Seamless scalability without downtime.

### Availability
- **VM:**
  - Availability depends on infrastructure setup.
  - Achieving high availability may require complex configurations.
- **App Service:**
  - Built-in high availability features.
  - Ensures high availability without manual intervention.

### Workflow
- **VM:**
  - Involves provisioning, configuring, and maintaining infrastructure.
  - Management of deployment pipelines and updates.
- **App Service:**
  - Simplified deployment workflows.
  - Integration with popular CI/CD tools.

## Choosing the Appropriate Solution

- **VM:** 
  - Suitable for specific infrastructure requirements or custom configurations.
- **App Service:** 
  - Ideal for modern web applications prioritizing ease of deployment, scalability, and high availability.

## Justification

- **App Service:** 
  - Cost-effective, managed platform.
  - Seamless scalability and high availability.
  - Simplified deployment workflows.

## App Changes Influencing Decision

- Custom infrastructure requirements may favor VM solution.
- Significant increases in traffic may require more granular scaling control.
- Compliance or security constraints may necessitate VM for fine-grained control.
